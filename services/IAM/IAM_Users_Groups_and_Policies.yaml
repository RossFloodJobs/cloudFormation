 user is a member a users group and an admin group. groups each have
 different IAM policies associated with m. Note: This example also creates an
 AWSAccessKeyId/AWSSecretKey pair associated with new user. example is somewhat
 contrived since it creates all users and groups, typically you would be creating
 policies, users and/or groups contain references to existing users or groups
 in your environment. Note you will need to specify CAPABILITY_IAM flag
 when you create stack to allow this template to execute. You can do this through
  AWS management console by clicking on check box acknowledging you understand
 this template creates IAM resources or by specifying CAPABILITY_IAM flag to
  cfn-create-stack command line tool or CreateStack API call.'
